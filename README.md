# libradocs
This is the Github for the Libra website. The resolution the site is made for 1920 x 969 resolution, so if your screen resolution is different, the window will show scrollbars or be cut off.

The code uses folders, so make sure to download the entire Libra folder as is, then open an html file within the html folder. Some previous versions of the code were not organized, with one exception that had the folders included in the .zip file. If the css doesn't load, the files have not been saved to your local machine properly.
