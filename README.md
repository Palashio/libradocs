# libradocs
Libra documentation; will be up soon!

This is the Github for the website. The resolution the site is made for 1920 x 969 resolution, so if something isn't working properly then try scaling the window to that size using chrome developer options and refresh the page.

The code uses folders, so make sure to download the entire Libra folder as is, then open an html file within the html folder. Some previous versions of the code were not organized, with one exception that had the folders included in the .zip file. If the css doesn't load, they files have not been saved to your local machine properly.
