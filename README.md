Libra documentation; will be up soon!

This is the Github for the website. If you are testing out the site, use the zip file as the files within are already in the proper directories. Direcly pulling from the github won't organize the files into the proper directories and the code references will break (TBD: make folders on github as well). The resolution the site is made for 1920 x 969 resolution, so if something isn't working properly then try scaling the window to that size using chrome developer options and refresh the page.
