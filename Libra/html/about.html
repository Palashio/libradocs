        <h1 id="about-keras">About Libra</h1>
        <p>Libra is a machine learning API that combines the functionalities of Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn and makes building and deploying machine learning models as simple as a one line function call. It hopes to democratize the powers of artificial intelligence to all non-technical/a>.
        It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.</p>

        <h2 id="why-this-name-keras">Why this name, Keras?</h2>
        <p>Keras (κέρας) means <em>horn</em> in Greek. It is a reference to a literary image from ancient Greek and Latin literature, first found in the <em>Odyssey</em>, where dream spirits (<em>Oneiroi</em>, singular <em>Oneiros</em>) are divided between those who deceive dreamers with false visions, who arrive to Earth through a gate of ivory, and those who announce a future that will come to pass, who arrive through a gate of horn. It's a play on the words κέρας (horn) / κραίνω (fulfill), and ἐλέφας (ivory) / ἐλεφαίρομαι (deceive).</p>
        <p>Keras was initially developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System).</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>"Oneiroi are beyond our unravelling - who can be sure what tale they tell? Not all that men look for comes to pass. Two gates there are that give passage to fleeting Oneiroi; one is made of horn, one of ivory. The Oneiroi that pass through sawn ivory are deceitful, bearing a message that will not be fulfilled; those that come out through polished horn have truth behind them, to be accomplished for men who see them."</em> Homer, Odyssey 19. 562 ff (Shewring translation).</p>
